          <h2> The court</h2>
          <button class="offensivecourt" data-desc="The five positions on offense work in concert to create scoring opportunities. The Point Guard (PG), or '1', is the floor general, bringing the ball upcourt, calling plays, and distributing the ball with vision to get teammates open. The Shooting Guard (SG), or '2', is primarily a perimeter scorer, adept at three-pointers and mid-range shots, often running off screens. The Small Forward (SF), or '3', is the versatile swingman, capable of scoring both inside and outside, driving to the basket, and is often the teams best all-around offensive player. Down low, the Power Forward (PF), or 4, and the Center (C), or 5, focus on interior scoring, setting screens for guards, and securing offensive rebounds for second-chance points. This coordinated movement, passing, and screening is essential for breaking down the defense and finding an open shot.">Offensive Court</button>
          <button class="defensivecourt" data-desc="Defensive Positions and Strategy
Defensive positions are assigned roles that collectively aim to prevent the opponent from scoring. The Point Guard (PG) maintains constant on-ball pressure, guiding the offense's direction. The Shooting Guard (SG) and Small Forward (SF) focus on defending the perimeter, chasing through screens, and closing out on shooters. The Power Forward (PF) and Center (C) form the interior defense, blocking out for rebounding and acting as rim protectors. When applying strategy, Man-to-Man defense assigns each defender to a specific offensive player, emphasizing individual responsibility and forcing opponents to win one-on-one battles, but it can be exploited by screens and mismatches. Conversely, Zone Defense assigns players to protect specific areas of the court (e.g., a 2-3 set), which clogs the lane, encourages longer jump shots, and conserves energy, but it is vulnerable to quick passing, outside shooting, and gaps in the high post. The choice between these schemes depends on the opponent's strengths and the defensive team's personnel, with effective defense relying heavily on communication and proper rotation.">Defensive Court</button>

          <h3> The Positions</h3>
          <button class="pg" data-desc="The floor general who initiates the offense, runs plays, and dictates the pace. They possess elite court vision and passing skills to distribute the ball. Defensively, they apply constant on-ball pressure to disrupt the opponent's offense and call out switches.">Point Guard</button>
          <button class="sg" data-desc="Primarily a perimeter scorer who specializes in outside shooting, often running off screens to get open for catch-and-shoot opportunities. Defensively, they chase the opponent's strongest wing scorer, fighting through screens and denying passing lanes.">Shooting Guard</button>
          <button class="sf" data-desc="The most versatile player, capable of scoring both inside (driving) and outside (shooting). They handle the ball and rebound effectively. Defensively, they guard the opponent's swingman and use their length to disrupt passes and score in transition.">Small Forward</button>
          <button class="pf" data-desc="An interior player who scores near the basket, sets solid screens, and excels at securing rebounds (both offensive and defensive). Defensively, they guard the post and help rotate to challenge drivers, acting as the primary weak-side helper.">Power Forward</button>
          <button class="c" data-desc="The rim protector and paint anchor. Offensively, they score in the post and finish strong near the basket. Defensively, their primary role is to block shots, deter drives, and secure crucial defensive rebounds, acting as the last line of defense.">Center</button>
          <button class="sixth" data-desc="The 6th Man is the primary substitute, a player who does not start the game but is often the first and most impactful player off the bench. Their role is to provide a spark and maintain, or elevate, the team's level of play when the starters rest. They typically offer a high level of offense, often bringing scoring punch, playmaking, or energy to shift the momentum of the game. The 6th Man usually plays minutes comparable to a starter and is often relied upon to lead the second unit.">Sixth Man</button>
