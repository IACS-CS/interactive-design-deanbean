            <button class="offensivecourt" data-desc="The five positions on offense work in concert to create scoring opportunities. The Point Guard (PG), or '1', is the floor general, bringing the ball upcourt, calling plays, and distributing the ball with vision to get teammates open. The Shooting Guard (SG), or '2', is primarily a perimeter scorer, adept at three-pointers and mid-range shots, often running off screens. The Small Forward (SF), or '3', is the versatile swingman, capable of scoring both inside and outside, driving to the basket, and is often the teams best all-around offensive player. Down low, the Power Forward (PF), or 4, and the Center (C), or 5, focus on interior scoring, setting screens for guards, and securing offensive rebounds for second-chance points. This coordinated movement, passing, and screening is essential for breaking down the defense and finding an open shot.">Offensive Court</button>
            <button class="defensivecourt" data-desc="Defensive Positions and Strategy
Defensive positions are assigned roles that collectively aim to prevent the opponent from scoring. The Point Guard (PG) maintains constant on-ball pressure, guiding the offense's direction. The Shooting Guard (SG) and Small Forward (SF) focus on defending the perimeter, chasing through screens, and closing out on shooters. The Power Forward (PF) and Center (C) form the interior defense, blocking out for rebounding, and acting as rim protectors. When applying strategy, Man-to-Man defense assigns each defender to a specific offensive player, emphasizing individual responsibility and forcing opponents to win one-on-one battles, but it can be exploited by screens and mismatches. Conversely, Zone Defense assigns players to protect specific areas of the court (e.g., a 2-3 set), which clogs the lane, encourages longer jump shots, and conserves energy, but it is vulnerable to quick passing, outside shooting, and gaps in the high post. The choice between these schemes depends on the opponent's strengths and the defensive team's personnel, with effective defense relying heavily on communication and proper rotation.">Defensive Court</button>

            <button class="pg" data-desc="The floor general who initiates the offense, runs plays, and dictates the pace. They possess elite court vision and passing skills to distribute the ball.

            <button class="sg" data-desc="Primarily a perimeter scorer who specializes in outside shooting, often running off screens to get open for catch-and-shoot opportunities.

            <button class="sf" data-desc="The most versatile player, capable of scoring both inside (driving) and outside (shooting). They handle the ball and rebound effectively.

            <button class="pf" data-desc="An interior player who scores near the basket, sets solid screens, and excels at securing rebounds (both offensive and defensive). Defensively, they guard the post and help rotate to challenge drivers, acting as the primary weak-side helper.">Power Forward</button>
            <button class="c" data-desc="The rim protector and paint anchor. Offensively, they score in the post and finish strong near the basket.

            <button class="sixth" data-desc="The 6th Man is the primary substitute, a player who does not start the game but is often the first and most impactful player off the bench. Their role is to provide a spark and maintain, or elevate, the team's level of play when the starters rest. They typically offer a high level of offense, often bringing scoring punch, playmaking, or energy to shift the momentum of the game. The 6th Man usually plays minutes comparable to a starter and is often relied upon to lead the second unit.">Sixth Man</button>

          <h3 class="dropdown-toggle" data-target="rules-buttons"> The Rules</h3>
          <div id="rules-buttons" class="dropdown-content">
            <button class="foulrules" data-desc="In basketball, it's important to distinguish between fouls (illegal contact) and violations (procedural errors). A personal foul occurs when a player makes illegal contact with an opponent. Common examples include blocking, where a defender impedes an offensive player without establishing a legal position, and its counterpart, charging, an offensive foul where the ball-handler runs into a stationary defender. Other contact fouls are holding, reaching-in (illegally contacting an opponent's arm or body while trying to steal), and setting an illegal screen (moving while setting a pick). If a player is fouled while in the act of shooting, it's a shooting foul, which results in free throws.
Violations, on the other hand, do not involve contact and always result in a turnover, where the other team gets the ball. The most frequent violations are traveling (moving your feet illegally while holding the ball), double dribble (dribbling with two hands or stopping and starting your dribble again), and the three-second violation (an offensive player remaining in the opponent's lane for too long). Other key violations include the backcourt violation (bringing the ball back over the half-court line) and the shot clock violation (failing to hit the rim with a shot attempt before the clock expires).">Fouls</button>
            <button class="techrules" data-desc="In addition to common personal fouls, basketball has two categories of severe infractions: technical fouls and flagrant fouls. A technical foul, or tech, is a non-contact penalty typically assessed for unsportsmanlike conduct. This includes actions like arguing with a referee, taunting an opponent, delaying the game, or even a coach straying too far from the sideline. The standard penalty is one free throw for the opposing team, after which play resumes from where it was interrupted. A player or coach who receives two technical fouls in a single game is automatically ejected.

Flagrant fouls are called for illegal contact that is deemed excessive, violent, or unnecessary, and not a legitimate attempt to play the ball. Officials review these plays to determine the severity. A Flagrant 1 is for unnecessary contact; the penalty is two free throws and possession of the ball for the fouled team. A Flagrant 2 is for contact that is both unnecessary and excessive or egregious, posing a significant risk of injury. It carries the same penalty—two free throws and possession—but the offending player is also immediately ejected from the game.">Techs</button>
            <button class="positionrules" data-desc="Basketball has strict positioning rules that define where players can and cannot be on the court. The three-second violation, or 'lane violation,' prevents offensive players from camping in the painted area (the key or lane) for more than three consecutive seconds while their team has possession. The restricted area is a semicircular arc beneath the basket where defensive players cannot take charges if the offensive player is driving to the rim. Out of bounds violations occur when a player steps on or over the boundary lines, or when the ball crosses these lines—possession then goes to the opposing team. The backcourt violation prevents a team from bringing the ball back across the half-court line after advancing it into the frontcourt. Additionally, defensive three-seconds (in the NBA) penalizes defenders who stand in the lane for three seconds without actively guarding an opponent within arm's reach. These positioning rules keep the game flowing and prevent players from exploiting certain areas of the court unfairly.">Positioning</button>
            <button class="miscrules" data-desc="Several additional rules govern basketball gameplay. The jump ball starts the game and resolves tied-up situations where two opposing players have equal control of the ball. Goaltending occurs when a player interferes with a shot on its downward arc toward the basket or while it's on the rim, resulting in automatic points for the shooting team. The closely guarded rule (in some leagues) limits how long a player can hold or dribble the ball while being actively defended. Substitutions can only occur during a dead ball (stoppage in play) and must be signaled to the officials. The shot clock (24 seconds in NBA, 30 in college) requires teams to attempt a shot that hits the rim within the allotted time or lose possession. Timeouts allow teams to stop play for strategy discussions, with limits on the number and duration per game. Finally, the bonus or penalty situation occurs after a team commits a certain number of fouls in a period, giving the fouled team free throws on all subsequent fouls, even non-shooting fouls.">Misc</button>
