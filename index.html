            <button class="sf" data-desc="The most versatile player who scores inside and outside. Handles the ball, rebounds, and defends multiple positions effectively. Uses length to disrupt passes and score in transition.">Small Forward</button>
            <button class="pf" data-desc="Interior player who scores near the basket and sets screens. Dominates the boards on both ends. Defensively guards the post and rotates to help stop drives.">Power Forward</button>
            <button class="c" data-desc="The rim protector and paint anchor. Scores in the post and finishes strong at the rim. Blocks shots, deters drives, and secures crucial rebounds as the last line of defense.">Center</button>

            <button class="techrules" data-desc="Technical fouls penalize unsportsmanlike conduct without contact (arguing, taunting). Result in one free throw; two techs equals ejection. Flagrant fouls are for excessive contact—Flagrant 1 is unnecessary, Flagrant 2 is egregious and causes immediate ejection.">Technical & Flagrant</button>
            <button class="positionrules" data-desc="Three-second violation prevents offensive camping in the lane. Restricted area stops defensive charges under the basket. Out of bounds and backcourt violations control court boundaries. These rules maintain fair play and game flow.">Positioning Rules</button>
            <button class="miscrules" data-desc="Jump balls start games and resolve ties. Goaltending awards automatic points for shot interference. Shot clock requires attempts within time limits. Timeouts pause play for strategy. Bonus/penalty gives free throws after team fouls accumulate.">Additional Rules</button>
